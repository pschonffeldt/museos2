# ðŸŽ¨ Museos2

Museos2 is a growing platform that allows users to explore all the museums available in Chile.
It helps visitors plan their trips by showing museum locations, opening hours, pricing (including special discounts), and directions â€” all in one place.

The goal is to create a unified hub for cultural exploration in Chile, making it easier for both locals and travelers to navigate the countryâ€™s museums without unexpected surprises.
